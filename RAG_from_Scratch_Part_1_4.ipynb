As a term, hallucination has been somewhat generalized to cases when the model makes mistakes. Here, I would like to narrow down the problem of hallucination to cases where the model output is fabricated and not grounded by either the provided context or world knowledge.\\nThere are two types of hallucination:\\n\\nIn-context hallucination: The model output should be consistent with the source content in context.\\nExtrinsic hallucination: The model output should be grounded by the pre-training dataset. However, given the size of the pre-training dataset, it is too expensive to retrieve and identify conflicts per generation. If we consider the pre-training data corpus as a proxy for world knowledge, we essentially try to ensure the model output is factual and verifiable by external world knowledge. Equally importantly, when the model does not know about a fact, it should say so.'),\n",

Data crawled from the public Internet is the most common choice and thus out-of-date, missing, or incorrect information is expected. As the model may incorrectly memorize this information by simply maximizing the log-likelihood, we would expect the model to make mistakes.\\nFine-tuning New Knowledge#\\nFine-tuning a pre-trained LLM via supervised fine-tuning and RLHF is a common technique for improving certain capabilities of the model like instruction following.

(2024) proposed an evaluation method for checking long-form factuality in LLMs, named SAFE (Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator; code). The main difference compared to FActScore is that for each self-contained, atomic fact, SAFE uses a language model as an agent to iteratively issue Google Search queries in a multi-step process and reason about whether the search results support or do not support the fact. In each step, the agent generates a search query based on a given fact to check, as well as previously obtained search results. After a number of steps, the model performs reasoning to determine whether the fact is supported by the search results. According to the experiments, SAFE approach works better than human annotators despite of 20x cheaper: 72% agreement rate with humans and 76% win rate over humans when they disagree.'),\n",

Unanswerable questions are sourced from online forums with human annotations while answerable questions are sourced from SQuAD, HotpotQA and TriviaQA based on text similarity with unanswerable questions.\\nLongFact (Wei et al. 2024 ) is designed for checking long-form generation factuality.
